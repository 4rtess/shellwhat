---------

``shellwhat`` enables you to write Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) for interactive Shell exercises on DataCamp.

- If you are new to teaching on DataCamp, check out https://authoring.datacamp.com.
- If you want to learn what SCTs are and how they work, visit `this article <https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/exercises/technical-details/sct.html>`_ specifically.

If you are new to writing SCTs for Shell exercises, start with the ``protowhat`` docs (`link <https://protowhat.readthedocs.io>`_)
that explain the concept of state, SCT chaining, and how this relates to abstract syntax trees, in addition to providing documentation
on all SCT functions that are shared with the ``sqlwhat`` package (used for writing SCTs for SQL exercises).

After consulting the resources above, you can continue with this site that features:

- Articles that list best practices commonly used SCT patterns.
- Reference documentation for all SCT functions that are specific to Shell exercises.
