Glossary
--------

This article lists some example solutions. For each of these solutions, an SCT
is included, as well as some example student submissions that would pass and fail. In all of these, a submission that
is identical to the solution will evidently pass.

.. note:: 

    These SCT examples are not golden bullets that are perfect for your situation.
    Depending on the exercise, you may want to focus on certain parts of a statement, or be 
    more accepting for different alternative answers.

All of these examples come from the `Intro to Shell for Data Science <https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell-for-data-science>`_
and `
Introduction to Git for Data Science <https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science>`_ courses. You can have a look at their
respective GitHub sources `here <https://github.com/datacamp/courses-intro-to-unix-shell>`_ (public) and
`here <https://github.com/datacamp/courses-intro-to-git>`_ (viewable by DataCamp employees only), respectively.


Checking the ``ls`` statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: shell

    # solution command
    ls

.. code::

    # sct
    Ex().check_correct(
        has_expr_output('ls'),
        TODO
    )

.. code-block:: shell

    # commands that pass
    

    # commands that fail
